# Subtask 02: Trademark Registration

**Status:** Not Started
**Depends on:** 01-research (must complete first)
**Filing Method:** DIY USPTO (self-file)

## Objective

File trademark application and secure brand assets based on research findings.

## Decision: DIY USPTO Filing

Based on research in [03-filing-service-research](../03-filing-service-research/README.md), we're proceeding with self-filing directly through USPTO rather than using a third-party service.

**Rationale:**
- Cost savings: $350 vs $549-$1,249 with services
- Full control over application
- Services provide minimal value-add for straightforward filings
- Optional: 1-hour IP attorney consultation ($100-250) for review before submission
