# Subtask 03: Trademark Filing Service Research

**Status:** Complete
**Created:** 2025-12-26

## Objective

Research modern trademark filing services that offer comprehensive trademark registration at lower cost than traditional attorney-based filing. Evaluate options based on cost, features, reviews, and suitability for a SaaS startup.

## Requirements

- Compare popular trademark filing services (e.g., LegalZoom, Trademarkia, TrademarkEngine, etc.)
- Look for newer/emerging services that may offer better value
- Find recent reviews and user experiences (2024-2025)
- Evaluate features: search, filing, monitoring, international support
- Consider cost vs. DIY USPTO filing (~$250-350/class)
- Note any services with Madrid Protocol support for international filing

## Findings

### Important: USPTO Fee Changes (January 18, 2025)

Before comparing services, note that the USPTO eliminated the cheaper TEAS Plus option:

| Fee Type | Before Jan 2025 | After Jan 2025 |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Base application (per class) | $250 (TEAS Plus) / $350 (TEAS Standard) | **$350** (unified) |
| Custom description surcharge | N/A | +$200/class |
| Insufficient info surcharge | N/A | +$100/class |
| Madrid Protocol (Sec. 66a) | $500/class | **$600/class** |

### Class 42 (SaaS) Filing Tips

For "Artifact Review" as a SaaS platform:

1. **Class 42 is correct** for software-as-a-service (non-downloadable)
2. **Consider Class 9** if you ever offer downloadable versions
3. **Specimen must show:**
   - Screenshot of login page/app interface
   - Clear association between mark and service description
   - "Login" button (not just "Contact Us" or "Download")
4. **Use pre-approved descriptions** from USPTO ID Manual to avoid $200 surcharge
5. **Conduct comprehensive search** - tech industry is saturated with overlapping names

---

### Common Complaints Across All Services

1. **Office actions are extra** - ~57-80% of applications receive office actions; most services charge $149-$800 extra
2. **"Attorney review" varies widely** - May be quick glance by paralegal, not substantive legal analysis
3. **Direct-hit searches miss conflicts** - USPTO uses "likelihood of confusion," not exact matches
4. **Refund policies are strict** - Once any work begins, refunds are typically denied
5. **Subscription traps** - Some services auto-enroll in monitoring/protection at recurring charges

**Key quote:** "LegalZoom, Trademarkia, and similar services... are not law firms, they rely on automated forms (not legal analysis), and they're not responsible if your application gets denied."

## Recommendation

### For "Artifact Review" SaaS Platform

**Primary Recommendation: Trademark Engine (Deluxe) or DIY with Attorney Consultation**

#### Option A: Budget-Conscious ($549-600 total)
**Trademark Engine Deluxe ($199 + $350 USPTO)**

- Good for: Getting the paperwork right, basic search included
- Risk: If office action occurs, add $149 for response
- Total potential cost: $549-$698

**Why:** Best balance of cost and support for a straightforward SaaS name like "Artifact Review." The name is descriptive enough that a comprehensive search is important, but the Deluxe tier provides adequate search coverage.

#### Option B: Self-File with IP Attorney Review (~$450-600 total)
**DIY USPTO filing ($350) + 1-hour attorney consultation (~$100-250)**

- Highest control, real legal advice
- Attorney can review before filing
- Best specimen/description guidance for Class 42

**Why:** The USPTO's own guidance is clear, and a 1-hour consult with an IP attorney can catch issues that automated services miss. Many IP attorneys offer flat-rate trademark consultations.

#### Option C: Future International Expansion ($949+)
**Trademarkia Standard ($599 + $350)**

- Only if Madrid Protocol is a near-term priority
- Be prepared for potential hidden costs
- Budget extra for office action response

**Why:** Only major consumer service with robust Madrid Protocol support. However, be cautious about billing practices and read all terms carefully.

### What to Avoid

1. **LegalZoom** - Overpriced for what you get; same search quality as cheaper options
2. **Any "Basic" tier** - Essentially paying for form-filling you can do yourself
3. **Services without office action pricing clarity** - Get this in writing upfront

### Budget Planning

| Scenario | Estimated Cost |
|----------|----------------|
| Smooth filing (no office action) | $549-$600 |
| Office action required | $700-$900 |
| Two classes (42 + 9) | $900-$1,200 |
| With Madrid Protocol (later) | +$600-1,000 per country |

### Next Steps

1. Complete comprehensive trademark search (Subtask 02)
2. If "Artifact Review" shows clear, proceed with Trademark Engine Deluxe or DIY
3. Prepare Class 42 specimen (login page screenshot with mark visible)
4. Use USPTO ID Manual pre-approved descriptions to avoid $200 surcharge
5. Budget $150-200 contingency for potential office action response
