# Subtask 01: Trademark Research

**Status:** In Progress
**Last Updated:** 2024-12-24

## Objective

Conduct comprehensive trademark availability research for "Artifact Review" before filing.

## Checklist

### USPTO Search
- [x] Search for "Artifact Review" (exact match) - No exact match found
- [x] Search for "Artifact" alone in Class 42 (SaaS) and Class 9 (software) - Found Valve's ARTIFACT (87557704)
- [x] Identify similar marks that could cause confusion - No confusing marks in SaaS/collaboration space
- [x] Document any potential conflicts - See findings below

### Trademark Class Identification
- [x] Confirm Class 42 (SaaS, software as a service) applies - **YES, primary class**
- [x] Determine if Class 9 (downloadable software) is needed - Recommended for comprehensive protection
- [ ] Draft goods/services description for application

### Common Law Search
- [x] Search for unregistered businesses using the name - None found
- [x] Check state business name registrations (CA, NY, TX, FL, DE) - None found
- [x] Search iOS App Store for "Artifact Review" - None found
- [x] Search Google Play Store for "Artifact Review" - None found
- [x] General web search for competing uses - Only generic/descriptive use found

### Social Handle Availability
- [x] Twitter/X: @artifactreview - **AVAILABLE**
- [x] LinkedIn: /company/artifactreview - **AVAILABLE**
- [x] GitHub: /artifactreview - **AVAILABLE**
- [x] Product Hunt - **AVAILABLE**

### International (Optional)

## Findings

### Overall Risk Assessment: **LOW** ✓

### USPTO Search Results
- **"Artifact Review" exact match:** Not found
- **"Artifact" in Class 42/9:** Valve Corporation's ARTIFACT (87557704) for gaming - different market, no conflict
- **Similar marks:** No confusingly similar marks in SaaS/collaboration/review space

### Common Law Search Results
See detailed report: [common-law-usage-report.md](./common-law-usage-report.md)

Key findings:
- **State business registrations:** No "Artifact Review" entities in CA, NY, TX, FL, or DE
- **App stores:** No apps using "Artifact Review" as product name
- **Web presence:** Term used generically as process description, NOT as brand
- **Competing products:** None found in target market (AI-generated artifact collaboration)

### Social Handle Availability
| Platform | Handle | Status | Priority |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| Twitter/X | @artifactreview | ✅ Available | HIGH - Secure immediately |
| LinkedIn | /company/artifactreview | ✅ Available | HIGH - Secure immediately |
| GitHub | /artifactreview | ✅ Available | HIGH - Secure immediately |
| Product Hunt | Artifact Review | ✅ Available | MEDIUM - Cannot pre-register |

**Note:** GitHub user @artifact-review (hyphenated) exists but is inactive with 0 repos.

### Potential Considerations
1. **Descriptiveness:** USPTO may view "Artifact Review" as descriptive, requiring evidence of acquired distinctiveness
2. **Valve's ARTIFACT:** Different market (gaming), no conflict expected
3. **Generic use:** "artifact review" used as process term in software dev/academia - mitigate with consistent branding

## Recommendation

### **GO** - Proceed with trademark application and brand development

**Rationale:**
1. No blocking conflicts found in USPTO, common law, or international preliminary searches
2. All primary social handles available - secure immediately
3. Market timing is advantageous (emerging AI artifact review space)
4. Low risk with proper branding strategy

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **TODAY:** Register social handles (Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub)
2. **This Week:** File USPTO trademark application for Classes 42 and 9
3. **Ongoing:** Establish consistent brand usage with ™ symbol

### Pending Items
- [ ] Complete international trademark search (WIPO, EUIPO, UK, Canada, Australia)
- [ ] Draft formal goods/services description for USPTO application
