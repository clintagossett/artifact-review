# Task 17 Session Resume

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-28
**Session:** Phase 3 COMPLETE - Commenting System Fully Functional! 🎉

---

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed

#### Phase 1: Figma Lift (COMPLETE)
- DocumentViewer component with full commenting UI (2,197 lines)
- CommentToolbar with all interactions
- Mock data working visually
- Location: `tasks/00017-implement-commenting/01-phase-1-lift-figma/`

#### Phase 2: Backend API (COMPLETE) ✅
- **87/87 tests passing** - Full backend implementation
- 9 Convex functions (5 comment ops, 4 reply ops)
- 5 internal permission helpers
- 2,988 lines of production code and tests
- Location: `tasks/00017-implement-commenting/02-phase-2-backend/`
- Commit: d325166

#### Phase 3: Frontend Integration (COMPLETE) ✅

**Major Issues Fixed:**

1. **Cross-Origin Iframe Issue**
   - Problem: Convex .site URL vs localhost - couldn't access iframe.contentDocument
   - Solution: Created Next.js API proxy at `/api/artifact/[shareToken]/[...path]`
   - Proxies requests to Convex HTTP endpoint
   - Enables same-origin iframe access
   - File: `app/src/app/api/artifact/[shareToken]/[...path]/route.ts`

2. **React Closure Issue**
   - Problem: Event listeners captured stale values of activeToolMode/commentBadge
   - Solution: Added refs (activeToolModeRef, commentBadgeRef) to track current state
   - File: `app/src/components/artifact/DocumentViewer.tsx`

3. **Version ID Mismatch**
   - Problem: currentVersionId used mock IDs ('v1'), backend comments had real IDs
   - Solution: Use real versionId prop instead of mock version IDs
   - Result: Comments now filter correctly and display

**Hooks Created:**
- ✅ `app/src/hooks/useComments.ts` - Fetch comments for version
- ✅ `app/src/hooks/useCommentReplies.ts` - Fetch replies for comment
- ✅ `app/src/hooks/useCommentActions.ts` - Comment mutations (create, update, delete, resolve)
- ✅ `app/src/hooks/useReplyActions.ts` - Reply mutations (create, update, delete)

**Features Working:**
- ✅ Create comments → Saves to Convex backend
- ✅ View comments → Loads from backend and displays
- ✅ Create replies → Saves to backend (display TODO)
- ✅ Resolve/Unresolve → Toggles in backend with optimistic update
- ✅ Delete comments → Permission-based (author or owner)
- ✅ Real-time updates via Convex subscriptions
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates for better UX
- ✅ Badge mode cycling (off → ① → ∞)
- ✅ One-shot auto-disable after comment save
- ✅ Global click blocking when comment mode active

**Permissions:**
- ✅ Delete button shows only for:
  - Comment author (can delete own)
  - Artifact owner (can delete any - moderation)
- ✅ Red trash icon with confirmation dialog
- ✅ Permission checks use current user ID vs authorId/ownerId

**Commits (Phase 3):**
- 6e27a8e - Fix commenting system: React closure issue and same-origin iframe access
- 6bda533 - Fix import paths in hooks - use relative imports instead of @ alias
- e71fa58 - Wire commenting system to Convex backend
- 209052b - Add comment delete functionality with permission checks
- e78ff61 - Clean up debug logging from commenting system
- ad91010 - Fix: Use correct method to get current user ID for permission checks

### ⏳ Remaining Work (Lower Priority)

**Not Yet Implemented:**
- [ ] Display replies (they save but don't show in UI)
  - Need to fetch replies using `useCommentReplies` hook
  - Wire into comment thread display
- [ ] Edit comment content
  - Hook exists (`updateContent`)
  - Need UI trigger (edit icon/button)
- [ ] Edit reply content
  - Hook exists (`updateReply`)
  - Need UI trigger
- [ ] Element click prevention improvements
  - Currently blocks ALL clicks when comment mode active
  - Could refine to be more selective

## What's Working Now

### End-to-End Flow

**Create Comment:**
1. User clicks Comment button (badge cycles: null → ① → ∞)
2. User selects text or clicks element (with ID)
3. Comment tooltip appears
4. User types comment → Clicks "Comment"
5. Saves to Convex backend via `createComment()`
6. useComments hook receives update
7. Comment appears in sidebar immediately
8. Badge auto-disables if in one-shot mode (①)

**Resolve Comment:**
1. User clicks "Resolve" button
2. Optimistic update → UI updates immediately
3. Backend mutation via `toggleResolved()`
4. Real update confirms optimistic change

**Delete Comment:**
1. Trash icon shows only if:
   - currentUserId === comment.authorId (own comment)
   - OR currentUserId === artifactOwnerId (owner)
2. User clicks trash → Confirmation dialog
3. User confirms
4. Optimistic update → Comment removed from UI
5. Backend mutation via `softDelete()`

**Create Reply:**
1. User clicks "Reply" on comment
2. Reply textarea appears
3. User types reply → Clicks "Reply" button
4. Saves to backend via `createReply()`
5. (TODO: Reply doesn't show yet - need to wire display)

## Technical Details

### Next.js API Proxy

**Purpose:** Solve cross-origin iframe access issue

**Route:** `/api/artifact/[shareToken]/[...path]/route.ts`

**How it works:**
```typescript
// Client requests:
GET /api/artifact/abc123/v1/index.html

// Proxy fetches from:
GET https://mild-ptarmigan-109.convex.site/artifact/abc123/v1/index.html

// Returns same content, but now same-origin!
// iframe.contentDocument access ✅
```

**Benefits:**
- Enables DOM access for event listeners
- Text selection works
- Element clicking works
- Comment tooltips positioned correctly

### React Refs Pattern

**Problem:** Event listeners capture closure values at attachment time

**Solution:**
```typescript
// State (for React rendering)
const [activeToolMode, setActiveToolMode] = useState<ToolMode>(null);

// Ref (for event listeners)
const activeToolModeRef = useRef<ToolMode>(null);

// Keep in sync
useEffect(() => {
  activeToolModeRef.current = activeToolMode;
}, [activeToolMode]);

// Event listener uses ref (always current)
const handleClick = (e: Event) => {
  if (activeToolModeRef.current !== 'comment') return;
  // ...
};
```

### Comment Data Flow

```
User Action (UI)
  ↓
Mutation Hook (useCommentActions)
  ↓
Convex Mutation (comments.create)
  ↓
Backend Validation + Save
  ↓
Real-time Subscription Update
  ↓
useComments Hook Receives New Data
  ↓
React Re-render
  ↓
UI Updates Automatically
```

### Permission Model

**Delete Comment:**
```typescript
canDeleteComment(authorId: string): boolean {
  if (!currentUserId) return false;

  // Author can delete own
  if (currentUserId === authorId) return true;

  // Owner can delete any (moderation)
  if (currentUserId === artifactOwnerId) return true;

  return false;
}
```

**Edit Comment:**
- Only author (not implemented in UI yet)

**Resolve Comment:**
- Anyone with access (owner or reviewer)

## Known Issues / TODO

### 1. Replies Don't Display Yet
**Status:** Saves to backend ✅, Display ❌

**What's working:**
- `createReply()` saves to Convex successfully
- Backend has `getReplies` query implemented

**What's needed:**
- Fetch replies for each comment using `useCommentReplies` hook
- Wire into comment thread UI
- Display reply count badge

**Effort:** ~1 hour

### 2. Edit Functionality Not Wired
**Status:** Backend ready ✅, UI ❌

**What exists:**
- `updateContent` mutation (comments)
- `updateReply` mutation (replies)
- Hooks created

**What's needed:**
- Add edit icon/button to comments/replies
- Inline editing UI
- Save edited content

**Effort:** ~2 hours

### 3. Click Blocking Could Be Refined
**Status:** Works but aggressive

**Current behavior:**
- When comment mode active, ALL clicks blocked
- This includes tabs, accordions, links, buttons

**Possible improvement:**
- Only block clicks on commentable elements (with IDs)
- Let other elements work normally
- Trade-off: More complex logic

**Priority:** Low (current behavior is acceptable)

---

## Testing Status

### Backend Tests ✅
- **87/87 tests passing** (100% coverage)
- All CRUD operations tested
- Permission boundaries enforced

### Frontend Tests ⏳
- **Manual testing: PASS**
  - Comment creation: ✅
  - Comment display: ✅
  - Resolve/unresolve: ✅
  - Delete with permissions: ✅
  - Badge mode cycling: ✅
- **Automated tests: Not created**
  - Defer to separate testing task
  - Would use Playwright for E2E

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

### High Value
1. **Display replies** - Users expect to see their replies
   - Fetch using `useCommentReplies` hook
   - Wire into thread display
   - ~1 hour

### Medium Value
2. **Edit comment content** - Common user need
   - Add edit UI trigger
   - Inline editing
   - ~2 hours

3. **E2E tests** - Ensure stability
   - Playwright test suite
   - Full commenting flow
   - ~3 hours

### Lower Priority
4. **Refine click blocking** - Nice to have
5. **Toast notifications** - Better UX feedback
6. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Power user feature
