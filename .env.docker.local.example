# Run: ./scripts/agent-init.sh
#
# The script will:
# 1. Detect your agent name from the directory (artifact-review-{name} → {name})
# 2. Read ports and subnet from ../artifact-review-orchestrator/config.json
# 3. Generate .env.docker.local with correct configuration
#
# This ensures all agents get consistent, conflict-free port assignments.
