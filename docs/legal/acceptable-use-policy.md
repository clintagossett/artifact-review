# Acceptable Use Policy

*Last updated: February 17, 2026*

We recognize that many of you use Artifact Review to collaborate on innovative AI-generated work, and we do not wish to restrict that. However, we need a few rules to protect our users, our platform, and the broader community. If you are found to be in violation of any of the below policies, you will receive a notice via email. Unless you explain or correct your behavior within 72 hours, your account may be suspended or terminated. We will do our best to work with you and to ensure a fair outcome in all cases. However, flagrant violations, including those described under "Zero-Tolerance Activities," will result in immediate account termination.

When we say "Services" in this document, we mean all products created and maintained by **Artifact Review**, including the website and any associated APIs or features.
