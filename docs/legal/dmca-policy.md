## Reporting Copyright Infringement

If you believe that content hosted on or accessible through Artifact Review infringes your copyright, please submit a DMCA takedown notice containing the following information:

1. **A physical or electronic signature** of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf.
2. **Identification of the copyrighted work** claimed to have been infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.
3. **Identification of the material** that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material. Please provide the specific URL(s) of the content in question.
4. **Your contact information**, including your name, address, telephone number, and an email address.
5. **A statement** that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
6. **A statement** that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that is allegedly infringed.

If you believe that your content was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may submit a counter-notification containing the following information:

1. **Your physical or electronic signature.**
2. **Identification of the material** that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access was disabled.
3. **A statement under penalty of perjury** that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
4. **Your name, address, and telephone number**, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if your address is outside of the United States, any judicial district in which Artifact Review may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original notification of alleged infringement.

### Where to send your counter-notification

Send your counter-notification to the same address as the takedown notice:

**Email:** [dmca@artifactreview.com](mailto:dmca@artifactreview.com)

### What happens after a counter-notification

Upon receiving a valid counter-notification, we will:

1. Forward a copy of the counter-notification to the original complainant.
2. Inform the original complainant that the removed material may be restored in 10–14 business days.
3. Restore the removed material within 10–14 business days after receiving the counter-notification, unless the original complainant notifies us that they have filed a court action seeking to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity.

## Repeat Infringer Policy

In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, we maintain a policy to terminate, in appropriate circumstances, the accounts of users who are repeat infringers. We may also, at our sole discretion, limit access to the Services and/or terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.

We consider the following when evaluating repeat infringement:
- The number of valid takedown notices received against the user.
- Whether the user has filed valid counter-notifications.
- The nature and severity of the infringement.
- Any other relevant circumstances.

We handle all DMCA notices and counter-notifications in good faith. We encourage all parties to resolve disputes directly when possible before resorting to the formal DMCA process.
