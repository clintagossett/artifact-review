# Terms of Service

*Last updated: February 17, 2026*

From everyone at Artifact Review, thank you for using our products! We build them to help you do your best work.

When we say "Company", "we", "our", or "us" in this document, we are referring to **Artifact Review**.

When we say "Services", we mean our websites and any product created and maintained by Artifact Review.

When we say "You" or "your", we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services.

We may update these Terms of Service ("Terms") in the future. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take any other appropriate steps to notify account holders.

When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce a right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not mean we are waiving that right or provision. **These Terms do contain a limitation of our liability.**

If you violate any of the Terms, we may terminate your account.

## Account Terms

1. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password and for ensuring that any of your users do the same. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. We recommend all users set up two-factor authentication for added security where available.
2. You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our [Acceptable Use Policy](acceptable-use-policy.md), and you may not permit any of your users to do so, either.
3. You are responsible for all content posted to and activity that occurs under your account, including content posted by and activity of any users in your account.
4. You must be a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.

---

## Eligibility

You must be at least 16 years of age to use our Services. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement. If you are under 18, you represent that you have your parent's or guardian's permission to use the Services. We may require proof of age or parental consent at any time.

If you are using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms.

---

## Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes

1. If you are using a free version of one of our Services, it is really free: we do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for customers who pay for our Services — we do not sell your data.
2. For paid Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length of trial when you sign up. After the trial period, you need to pay in advance to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, we will freeze your account and it will be inaccessible until you make payment.
3. If you are upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan, we will charge your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the day of upgrade. For other upgrades or downgrades in plan level, the new rate starts from the next billing cycle.
4. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties.
5. We process refunds on a case-by-case basis. If you're ever unhappy with our products for any reason, contact our [support team](mailto:support@artifactreview.com) and we'll work with you to make it right. Examples: if you were charged for a month you meant to cancel, or if you forgot to cancel and haven't used the service, we're happy to refund those charges.

---

## Cancellation and Termination

1. You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. You can cancel your account at any time through your account settings or by contacting support. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not automatically considered cancellation.
2. **Data export.** Before canceling, we recommend exporting any data you wish to keep. We provide data export functionality within your account settings. Once your account is canceled, your content will become inaccessible.
3. All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services immediately upon account cancellation. Within 30 days, all content will be permanently deleted from active systems. Within 60 days, all content will be permanently deleted from our backups. We cannot recover this information once it has been permanently deleted.
4. If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up period, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged again. We do not automatically prorate unused time in the last billing cycle.
5. We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account will not be able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. For more details, see our [Acceptable Use Policy](acceptable-use-policy.md).
6. Verbal, physical, written, or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of a Company employee or officer will result in immediate account termination.

## Modifications to the Service and Prices

1. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.
2. Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record.

---

## Uptime, Security, and Privacy

1. Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an "as is" and "as available" basis.
2. We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services. We'll reach out to the account owner before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.
3. We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet.
4. When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You agree that Artifact Review may process your data as described in our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md) and for no other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following reasons:
   - **To help you with support requests you make.** We'll ask for express consent before accessing your account.
   - **On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated process partway through.** When we can fix the issue without looking at personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue.
   - **To safeguard Artifact Review.** We'll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole. If necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an abuse report investigation.
   - **To the extent required by applicable law.**
5. We use third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services. See the [Third-party services and subprocessors](privacy-policy.md#third-party-services-and-subprocessors) section of our Privacy Policy for a complete list.

## Copyright and Content Ownership

1. All content posted on the Services must comply with U.S. copyright law. We provide details on how to file a copyright infringement claim in our [DMCA Policy](dmca-policy.md).
2. You give us a limited license to use the content posted by you and your users in order to provide the Services to you, but we claim no ownership rights over those materials. All materials you submit to the Services remain yours.
3. We do not pre-screen content, but we reserve the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is available via the Service.
4. The Company or its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, including all intellectual property rights therein, and you obtain no ownership rights in the Services as a result of your use. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements of the Services without express written permission from the Company.
5. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or exploit any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the Services without the express written permission of the Company.

## AI-Generated Content

Artifact Review is a platform for uploading, sharing, and reviewing AI-generated artifacts. The following terms apply specifically to AI-generated content:

1. **Ownership.** You retain ownership of all content you upload to the Services, including AI-generated artifacts, to the extent that such content is protectable under applicable intellectual property law. We make no representations regarding the copyright status of AI-generated content under any jurisdiction.
2. **Copyright limitations.** You acknowledge that purely AI-generated content (content created entirely by artificial intelligence without meaningful human authorship) may not be eligible for copyright protection under current U.S. law. Uploading AI-generated content to the platform does not confer or establish copyright status on that content.
3. **Your representations.** You represent and warrant that you have the right to upload and share any content you submit to the Services, whether human-authored, AI-generated, or a combination thereof. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your uploaded content does not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party.
4. **No training use.** We do not use content uploaded to the Services to train AI or machine learning models. Your artifacts, comments, and review data are used solely to provide the Services to you and your team.
5. **Accuracy disclaimer.** The Company does not verify, endorse, or guarantee the accuracy, quality, safety, or fitness for any purpose of AI-generated artifacts uploaded to or shared through the Services. You use and rely on AI-generated content at your own risk.
6. **Embedded code.** AI-generated HTML artifacts may contain executable code (JavaScript, CSS, etc.). The Company is not responsible for the behavior, security, or effects of code contained within uploaded artifacts. Users should exercise caution when interacting with artifacts from untrusted sources.

## User-Generated Content License

1. By uploading content to the Services (including artifacts, comments, review feedback, and any other materials), you grant the Company a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, and display such content solely for the purpose of providing, maintaining, and improving the Services. This license continues for as long as your content remains on our Services, and terminates when your content is deleted from our systems (including backups) as described in our Privacy Policy.
2. You retain all ownership rights in your content. This license does not grant us the right to sell your content or to use it for purposes unrelated to providing the Services.
3. When you share content via share links, team workspaces, or other collaboration features, you acknowledge that other users who have been granted access may view, download, and interact with that content in accordance with the sharing permissions you set.
4. If you delete your account, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to remove your content from the Services, subject to the data retention timelines described in our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md).

---

## Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Services in compliance with our [Acceptable Use Policy](acceptable-use-policy.md), which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. Violations of the Acceptable Use Policy may result in suspension or termination of your account.

---

## DMCA and Copyright Infringement

We respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect our users to do the same. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). For details on how to submit a takedown notice or counter-notification, see our [DMCA Policy](dmca-policy.md).

We maintain a policy to terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers of copyright.

---

## Third-Party Services

The Services may integrate with or contain links to third-party websites, applications, or services. We are not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party services. Your interactions with third-party services are governed by those services' own terms and policies.

The third-party services we use to provide the Services are listed in the [Third-party services and subprocessors](privacy-policy.md#third-party-services-and-subprocessors) section of our Privacy Policy.

---

## Feedback

If you provide us with any feedback, suggestions, or ideas about the Services ("Feedback"), you grant us an unrestricted, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free right to use, incorporate, and exploit the Feedback for any purpose, including to improve the Services, without any obligation or compensation to you. This does not apply to your uploaded content, which remains subject to the [User-Generated Content License](#user-generated-content-license) above.

---

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from: (i) your use of the Services; (ii) your violation of these Terms; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including any intellectual property, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that your content caused damage to a third party.

This indemnification obligation will survive the termination of your account and these Terms.

---

## Limitation of Liability

***You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the Services; (v) any AI-generated content uploaded to, shared through, or accessed via the Services; or (vi) any other matter relating to these Terms or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.***

**In any case, the Company's total aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Services shall not exceed the greater of: (a) the total amounts you have paid to the Company in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim; or (b) one hundred U.S. dollars ($100).**

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. In such jurisdictions, the limitations and exclusions in this section will apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

## Dispute Resolution

### Informal resolution

Before filing a formal legal claim, you agree to first contact us at [support@artifactreview.com](mailto:support@artifactreview.com) to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. We'll try to resolve it within 30 days. If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days, either party may proceed with formal dispute resolution.

### Binding arbitration

Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services that is not resolved through informal resolution shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language and will take place in the State of Delaware (or remotely, at the arbitrator's discretion).

The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding on both parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

### Class action waiver

**You and the Company agree that any proceedings to resolve disputes will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor the Company will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.**

### Opt-out right

You may opt out of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions above by sending written notice to [legal@artifactreview.com](mailto:legal@artifactreview.com) within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. Your notice must include your name, account email address, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration. If you opt out, you may pursue claims in court.

### Exceptions

Nothing in this section prevents either party from (a) seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in court for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property; or (b) filing a claim in small claims court if the claim qualifies.

---

## Governing Law

These Terms and any disputes arising from or relating to them or the Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

For any disputes not subject to arbitration, you and the Company consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Delaware.

---

## Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect.

---

## Entire Agreement

These Terms, together with our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md), [Acceptable Use Policy](acceptable-use-policy.md), [DMCA Policy](dmca-policy.md), [Cookie Policy](cookie-policy.md), and [California Resident Notice](ccpa-notice.md), constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding your use of the Services and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, and communications, whether written or oral.
