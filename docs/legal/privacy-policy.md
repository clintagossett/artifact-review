# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 17, 2026*

The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.

This policy applies to all products and services built and maintained by **Artifact Review** (together, the "Services").

When we say "Company", "we", "our", or "us" in this document, we are referring to **Artifact Review**.

If you are a California resident, please see our [California Resident Notice at Collection](ccpa-notice.md), which includes additional disclosures as required by California law.

## What we collect and why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here's what that means in practice:

### Identity and access

When you sign up for Artifact Review, we ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, and optionally a company name. That's so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you product updates and other essential information. We may also send you optional surveys from time to time to help us understand how you use our products and to make improvements.

We'll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won't use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.

### Billing information

If you sign up for a paid plan, you will be asked to provide your payment information and billing address. Credit card information is submitted directly to our payment processor (Stripe) and doesn't hit Artifact Review servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for purposes of account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address so we can charge you for service, calculate any sales tax due, send you invoices, and detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

### Product interactions

We store on our servers the content that you upload or receive or maintain in your Artifact Review account. This includes HTML artifacts, comments, review feedback, and any files you upload. This is so you can use our products as intended — for example, to upload AI-generated artifacts and collaborate on reviews with your team. We keep this content as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we'll delete the content within 60 days.

### General geolocation data

We log the full IP address used to sign up a product account and retain that for use in mitigating future spammy signups. We also log all account access by full IP address for security and fraud prevention purposes, and we keep this login data for as long as your product account is active.

### Website interactions

We collect information about your browsing activity for analytics and statistical purposes such as conversion rate testing and experimenting with new product designs. This includes, for example, your browser and operating system versions, your IP address, which web pages you visited and how long they took to load, and which website referred you to us. If you have an account and are signed in, these web analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account until your account is no longer active.

### Voluntary correspondence

When you email Artifact Review with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including your email address, so that we have a history of past correspondence to reference if you reach out in the future.

We also store information you may volunteer, for example, written responses to surveys.

## How and why we use information

We use information about you for the purposes listed below:

- **To provide our Services.** For example, to set up and maintain your account, host your artifacts, provide customer service, process payments, and verify user information.
- **To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.** For example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features, fix bugs, and improve the user experience.
- **To protect our Services, our users, and the public.** For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting our rights and property.
- **To communicate with you.** For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Artifact Review. If you don't want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (We'll still send you important updates relating to your account.)

### Legal bases for collecting and using information (EU/UK)

For those in the European Union or United Kingdom, our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU/UK data protection laws are:

1. **The use is necessary to fulfill our commitments to you** under the applicable Terms of Service or other agreements, or to administer your account — for example, to enable access to our Services or charge you for a paid plan.
2. **The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.**
3. **The use is necessary to protect your vital interests** or those of another person.
4. **We have a legitimate interest** in using your information — for example, to provide and update our Services, to improve our Services, to safeguard our Services, to communicate with you, and to monitor and prevent problems.
5. **You have given us your consent** — for example, before we place certain non-essential cookies on your device.

## When we access or disclose your information

**To provide products or services you've requested.** We use some third-party subprocessors to help run our applications and provide the Services to you. See the [Third-party services and subprocessors](#third-party-services-and-subprocessors) section below for a complete list.

**To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.** If at any point we need to access your content to help you with a support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.

**To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses.** Accessing a customer's account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We want to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us. For more details, see our [Acceptable Use Policy](acceptable-use-policy.md).

**Aggregated and de-identified data.** We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the Services. We may use de-identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including marketing or analytics.

**When required under applicable law.** Artifact Review is a U.S. company and all data infrastructure is located in the U.S.

- **Requests for user data.** Our policy is to not respond to government requests for user data unless we are compelled by legal process or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. However, if U.S. law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us to disclose data, we must comply. Likewise, we will only respond to requests from government authorities outside the U.S. if compelled by the U.S. government through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. It is our policy to notify affected users before we disclose data unless we are legally prohibited from doing so, and except in some emergency cases.

- **Preservation requests.** Our policy is to comply with requests to preserve data only if compelled by the U.S. Federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f), or by a properly served U.S. subpoena for civil matters.

- **If we are audited by a tax authority**, we may be required to disclose billing-related information. If that happens, we will disclose only the minimum needed, such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.

**Business transfers.** In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy. We will notify you well before any of your personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Third-party services and subprocessors

We require all subprocessors to agree to privacy commitments and to process data only as instructed by us and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We may update this list from time to time as we add or change service providers. We will update this Privacy Policy accordingly when that happens.

## Cookies and tracking technologies

A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help remember login information and site preferences. It might also collect information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages visited, duration of visit, content viewed, and other click-stream data.

### Types of cookies we use

**Essential cookies.** These are required for the Services to function properly. They include authentication cookies (managed by Clerk), session management cookies, and security cookies. You cannot opt out of essential cookies while using our Services.

**Analytics cookies.** We use analytics tools to understand how users interact with our Services, which pages are most visited, and where users experience issues. These cookies help us improve the Services.

**Third-party cookies.** Some of our third-party services (such as Stripe for payment processing) may set their own cookies when you interact with their services through our platform.

### Managing cookies

You can adjust cookie retention settings and accept or block individual cookies in your browser settings, although our Services may not function properly if you turn off essential cookies.

For more details, see our [Cookie Policy](cookie-policy.md).

## Your rights with respect to your information

At Artifact Review, we strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Some of these rights include:

- **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared, or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this Privacy Policy.
- **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security, and processing of that information.
- **Right to Correction.** You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
- **Right to Erasure / "To Be Forgotten".** This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, from all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using our Services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.
- **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.
- **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of your personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)
- **Right to Object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
- **Right to Portability.** You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
- **Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making.** You have the right to object to and prevent any decision that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
- **Right to Non-Discrimination.** We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and updating your account information.

In some cases, we also need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, verifying your name and email address. If we are unable to verify you, we may be unable to respond to your requests.

If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at [privacy@artifactreview.com](mailto:privacy@artifactreview.com).

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. If you are in the EU or UK, you can contact your data protection authority to file a complaint or learn more about local privacy laws.

### Appeals process

In the event that we deny your request to exercise one of these rights, we will communicate this to you in writing. You may appeal our decision by responding in writing to our denial and stating that you would like to appeal. All appeals will be reviewed by an internal expert who was not involved in your original request. In the event that your appeal is also denied, this information will be communicated to you in writing.

## How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted. In addition, we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.

We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks. We encourage users to enable two-factor authentication for added account security where available.

We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet.

---

## What happens when you delete content

When you delete content in your Artifact Review account (such as artifacts, comments, or files), we mark it for deletion. Deleted content will be permanently removed from active systems within 30 days. Content may remain in backups for up to an additional 30 days after that. Altogether, any deleted content should be purged from all of our systems within 60 days.

If you choose to cancel your account, your content will become immediately inaccessible and should be purged from our systems in full within 60 days.

We recommend exporting any data you wish to keep before canceling your account or deleting content.

---

## Data retention

We keep your information for the time necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. Here are specific retention periods:

| Data Type | Retention Period |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Account information (name, email) | Duration of account + 60 days after deletion |
| Billing information | Duration of account + as required by tax/accounting law (typically 7 years) |
| Uploaded artifacts and comments | Duration of account + 60 days after deletion |
| Access logs (IP addresses, login activity) | Duration of account activity |
| Payment transaction records | As required by financial regulations (typically 7 years) |
| Support correspondence | 3 years after last contact, or duration of account |
| Web analytics data | 26 months from collection |

After the applicable retention period, we may delete and/or aggregate the information. We may also retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

---

## Location of site and data

Our products and services are operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, UK, or elsewhere outside of the United States, **please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States**. By using our Services and/or providing us with your personal information, you consent to this transfer.

---

## International data transfers

When personal data is transferred out of the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, it must be treated with the same level of protection granted under EU/UK privacy law.

For transfers of personal data from the EEA or UK to the United States, we rely on:

- **EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework** where applicable.
- **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** approved by the European Commission, which we incorporate into our agreements with subprocessors.

Our subprocessors who handle personal data on our behalf are also required to provide appropriate safeguards for international data transfers.

If you have questions about international data transfers, please contact us at [privacy@artifactreview.com](mailto:privacy@artifactreview.com).

---

## Data breach notification

In the event of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will:

- **Notify affected users** via email without undue delay, and no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of the breach where feasible.
- **Notify relevant supervisory authorities** as required by applicable law (including within 72 hours under GDPR, and as required by U.S. state breach notification laws).
- **Provide details** including the nature of the breach, categories and approximate number of individuals affected, likely consequences of the breach, and measures taken or proposed to address the breach.

We maintain an incident response plan and regularly test our ability to detect and respond to security incidents.

---

## Children's privacy

Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under 16. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 16, we will promptly delete that information. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us with personal information, please contact us at [privacy@artifactreview.com](mailto:privacy@artifactreview.com).

---

## Changes and questions

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take any other appropriate steps to notify users, such as posting a notice on our website or sending an email notification.

Have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights with respect to your information? Please get in touch by emailing us at [privacy@artifactreview.com](mailto:privacy@artifactreview.com) and we'll be happy to try to answer them!
