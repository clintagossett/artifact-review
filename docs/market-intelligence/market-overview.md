# Market Overview

## Market Position

**Category:** AI-Native Collaboration Infrastructure

**Positioning Statement:** "From AI output to stakeholder feedback in one click"

The platform occupies a new category at the intersection of:
- AI agent workflows (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf)
- Collaboration tools (Google Workspace, Office 365, Notion)
- Document review systems (Figma comments, Google Docs suggestions)

### Strategic Position

This is a **bridge product** solving a format mismatch:
- AI agents naturally produce HTML with full styling/structure control
- Enterprise collaboration tools don't handle HTML artifacts well
- Manual conversion loses fidelity and wastes time

**Target Market Segment:** Teams outside of Google Workspace and Adobe Creative Cloud ecosystems. Not competing for committed Google/Adobe users—targeting the gap where AI-first teams need collaboration tools that aren't tied to legacy productivity suites.

**Market Timing:** As AI-assisted workflows become standard (2024-2026), this friction multiplies across teams. Estimated 12-24 month window before native solutions mature or consolidate.

- **Buyer:** Head of Product, VP Product
- **Users:** Product Managers, Product Designers, PMs using AI agents
- **Budget:** Productivity tools, collaboration software
- **Procurement:** Team-level decision, minimal security requirements initially
- **Profile:** Teams using Notion, Linear, Slack, and AI tools—not locked into Google/Microsoft/Adobe suites
- **Mindset:** Tool-agnostic, best-of-breed approach, willing to adopt new platforms

### Secondary Expansion Targets

1. **Design Teams** - Share prototypes and design specs
2. **Engineering Teams** - Documentation reviews, technical specs
3. **Strategy/Operations** - One-pagers, presentations, reports
4. **Consultancies** - Client deliverables and proposal reviews

## Target User Personas

### Primary: Alex - AI-Powered Product Manager

**Demographics:**
- Role: Senior Product Manager at mid-market B2B SaaS
- Experience: 5-8 years in product
- Tools: Claude Code (daily), Jira, Figma, Google Workspace

**Behavior:**
- Generates 3-5 documents per week using Claude Code (PRDs, one-pagers, specs)
- Needs feedback from design, engineering, and leadership before shipping
- Currently copy-pastes to Google Docs (loses formatting) or shares screenshots (no collaboration)

**Pain Points:**
- "I spend 30 minutes reformatting AI output to make it shareable"
- "Tables and code blocks break when I paste into Docs"
- "Stakeholders can't comment on the HTML file directly"

**Jobs to Be Done:**
- Share AI-generated artifacts with non-technical stakeholders
- Get inline feedback without format conversion
- Track review status and approval workflow

**Success Metrics:**
- Time from "AI output finished" to "stakeholder reviewing" < 2 minutes
- Zero formatting loss in transition
- All feedback captured in one place

### Secondary: Morgan - Design Lead

**Demographics:**
- Role: Lead Product Designer
- Experience: 6-10 years
- Tools: Figma, Notion, occasionally Claude for copy/content

**Behavior:**
- Reviews PM specs and provides design feedback
- Sometimes generates HTML prototypes or design specs using AI
- Needs to collaborate with PMs, engineers, and other designers

**Pain Points:**
- "PMs send me Google Docs that don't match the original AI output"
- "I can't comment on specific sections of an HTML prototype"
- "Version control is chaos—email attachments everywhere"

**Jobs to Be Done:**
- Review PM artifacts with inline comments
- Share design prototypes for feedback
- Maintain context from AI generation through to implementation

---

### Tertiary: Jamie - Engineering Manager (Reviewer)

**Demographics:**
- Role: Engineering Manager
- Experience: 10+ years
- Tools: GitHub, Linear, Slack, minimal AI usage

**Behavior:**
- Reviews technical specs and PRDs from PMs
- Provides feasibility feedback and technical constraints
- Prefers async collaboration, not always in AI tools

**Pain Points:**
- "I don't have Claude Code, so I can't see the original context"
- "Screenshots are useless—I need to select text and ask questions"
- "I need to track what I've reviewed vs. what's still pending"

**Jobs to Be Done:**
- Review AI-generated specs without needing AI tool access
- Leave technical feedback inline
- Get notified when new versions are ready

## Market Size Analysis

### TAM (Total Addressable Market)

**Knowledge workers using AI tools globally**

| Segment | Population | Calculation |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Global knowledge workers | ~1 billion | (ILO, World Bank) |
| AI tool adoption rate (2024) | 35-40% | (Microsoft Work Trend Index, BCG) |
| Knowledge workers using AI | ~350-400M | |
| Avg. spend/user on collaboration tools | $15-30/mo | (Google Workspace, Office 365 benchmarks) |
| **TAM** | **$63-144B/year** | 350M × $15-30 × 12 |

**Note:** This is the broader collaboration tool market. Our slice is the subset generating and reviewing AI artifacts.

### SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)

**Product teams and knowledge workers generating AI artifacts**

| Segment | Population | Calculation |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Product Managers globally | ~1.5M | (Product Management orgs, LinkedIn data) |
| Adjacent roles (design, ops, strategy) | ~4.5M | 3x multiplier |
| Total potential users | ~6M | |
| AI agent adoption rate (daily users) | 30-35% | (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot usage) |
| Users generating shareable AI artifacts | ~2M | 6M × 33% |
| **SAM** | **$360M-600M/year** | 2M × $15-25/mo × 12 |

### SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market - Year 3)

## Market Trends Supporting Growth

### 1. AI Agent Adoption Accelerating

- 84% of developers use or plan to use AI coding tools (Stack Overflow 2024)
- 51% of developers use AI tools daily
- Product managers average 23 hours/week on documentation (prime AI use case)

### 2. Format Mismatch Growing

- AI tools produce HTML (full control over structure/style)
- Traditional AI in Docs/Word is generative but not transformative
- Gap between "AI-generated" and "stakeholder-ready" widening

### 3. Team Collaboration is Hybrid

- 60-70% of teams are remote or hybrid post-2020
- Async collaboration tools growing faster than real-time
- Reviewers often don't have same tools as creators

### 4. Enterprise Slow to Adapt

- Google/Microsoft focused on keeping users inside their ecosystems
- No native HTML import with fidelity
- No visible roadmap for external AI output integration

---

## Market Risks

### Competitive Convergence (12-24 months)

- **Google Docs / Microsoft Word** could add native HTML import
- **Claude / ChatGPT** could add direct export to Google Docs/Word
- **Notion / Coda** could expand into AI artifact hosting

**Mitigation:** Move fast, build network effects within teams, differentiate on workflow depth

### Market Education Required

- Users may not recognize the pain until they try AI workflows
- "Just use Google Docs" is the default objection
- Need to demonstrate ROI quickly

**Mitigation:** Freemium model, frictionless onboarding, clear before/after comparison

### Fragmented AI Ecosystem

- If AI tools consolidate (e.g., Microsoft owns everything), need evaporates
- If AI tools add native collaboration, need evaporates

**Mitigation:** Build for multi-tool world, focus on review workflow depth, not just format conversion

---

## Go-to-Market Fit

### Why This Market Now

1. **Pain is validated** - Conversion tools already exist (MassiveMark, MD2Doc)
2. **Users are vocal** - Feature requests on Claude Code GitHub, Reddit complaints
3. **Incumbents aren't solving** - Google/Microsoft building moats, not bridges
4. **Adoption curve** - AI tools crossing into mainstream (2024-2025)

### Land-and-Expand Motion

This is a **team product** with viral potential:

1. One PM uploads artifact → invites stakeholders to review
2. Reviewers see value → start uploading their own artifacts
3. Team lead sees usage → purchases seats for whole team
4. Expands to adjacent teams (design, eng, strategy)

**Critical:** Reviewers must be able to participate without paid accounts (freemium review access).
