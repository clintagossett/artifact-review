## Key Takeaways

### For Privacy Policy Development

1. **Two-Tier Data Model**
   - **Customer Data**: Content uploaded by users (documents, comments) - organization controls retention
   - **Platform Data**: Usage metadata, analytics, account information - platform controls retention

2. **Clear Legal Bases**
   - Contractual necessity (service delivery)
   - Legitimate interests (product improvement, security)
   - Legal compliance (responding to valid requests)
   - Consent (marketing, optional features)

3. **Robust User Rights Section**
   - Access, correction, deletion, portability, objection
   - Separate sections for EEA/UK (GDPR) and California (CCPA)
   - Clear procedures for exercising rights

4. **Security Transparency**
   - Certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
   - Encryption standards (in transit and at rest)
   - Organizational safeguards
   - Honest disclaimers about transmission risks

5. **Collaborative Platform Considerations**
   - Clarify organizational control over workspace data
   - Explain sharing features (team workspaces, external sharing)
   - Address third-party integrations
   - Detail administrator capabilities

### For Terms of Service Development

1. **B2B Focus**
   - Distinguish between organization (customer) and individual users
   - Clear roles and responsibilities for workspace administrators
   - Seat-based licensing terms

2. **Usage-Based Limits**
   - Define free tier limits clearly (document count, version limits, review periods)
   - Upgrade paths and procedures
   - Overage handling (if applicable)

3. **Content Ownership**
   - Customer owns all uploaded content
   - Platform has limited license to process/display content for service delivery
   - No training on customer data (explicit statement)

4. **Service Level Commitments**
   - Availability targets (consider 99.9% for enterprise)
   - Support SLAs by tier (response times)
   - Downtime credit procedures

5. **Dispute Resolution**
   - Clear governing law (consider Delaware or California for SaaS)
   - Arbitration with opt-out (strengthens enforceability)
   - Informal resolution requirement before formal proceedings

### For Data Processing Agreement (DPA) Development

1. **Mandatory for Enterprise Sales**
   - Required by GDPR Article 28 for any data processing relationship
   - Standard expectation in B2B SaaS
   - Often required before security reviews and procurement

2. **Essential Elements**
   - Processing scope (subject matter, duration, nature, purpose, data types, data subjects)
   - Controller instructions (specific tasks: hosting, storage, processing)
   - Security measures (encryption, access controls, training)
   - Confidentiality obligations
   - Subprocessor management (list, notification, approval)
   - Data breach notification procedures
   - Audit rights (balanced with operational feasibility)
   - Data return/deletion upon termination

3. **Use Standard Clauses**
   - EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for international transfers
   - Reduces negotiation time
   - Accepted by regulators globally

4. **Subprocessor Transparency**
   - Maintain public list of subprocessors (e.g., AWS, Convex, analytics providers)
