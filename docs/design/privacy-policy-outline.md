## Design & Tone Guidelines

- **Short sentences**: Keep sentences under 25 words
- **Active voice**: "We collect your email" vs. "Your email is collected by us"

### Structure

- **Skimmable**: Use headers, bullets, tables
- **Layered**: Summary at top, details in sections
- **Linked**: Cross-reference related sections
- **Table of contents**: Jump links at the top

### Trust Signals

- **Explicit commitments**: "We do not sell your data" in bold
- **User control**: Emphasize rights and choices
- **Transparency**: Explain "why" not just "what"
- **Honesty**: Admit limitations ("no system is 100% secure")
