## Unique Value Proposition

### Primary UVP Statement

> **"The collaboration layer for AI-native teams. Share HTML artifacts from Claude Code, Cursor, or any AI tool—get inline feedback from stakeholders who don't need AI tool access. Zero format loss, one-click sharing."**

### UVP Breakdown

**What we do:**
- Platform for uploading, sharing, and reviewing AI-generated HTML artifacts

**Who it's for:**
- Product managers, designers, and teams using AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)

**Core problem solved:**
- Format mismatch between AI-native HTML output and traditional collaboration tools (Google Docs, Notion)

**Key differentiation:**
- Reviewers don't need AI tool licenses
- 100% format fidelity (no copy-paste degradation)
- One-click sharing via MCP integration with Claude Code

**Value delivered:**
- Save 2-3 hours/week vs. manual Google Docs conversion
- Get feedback in hours, not days
- Professional presentation to executives and stakeholders

---

## Category Positioning

### Primary Category

**"AI Artifact Collaboration Platform"**

We're creating a new category at the intersection of:
- AI agent workflows (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf)
- Document collaboration tools (Google Workspace, Notion)
- Review systems (Figma comments, PDF annotations)

### Why This Category Matters

**Market Timing:** As AI-assisted workflows become standard (2024-2026), the friction between AI output formats and collaboration tools multiplies. We're the bridge.

**Category Leadership:** First-mover advantage in "AI artifact review"—establishing the category before incumbents adapt.

### Alternative Category Positioning (If Needed)

If "AI Artifact Collaboration" is too new/niche for early customers:

**Fallback Category:** "Document Review & Collaboration Software"
- More familiar to buyers
- Easier to compare pricing (vs. Adobe Acrobat, Filestage)
- Risk: Commoditizes our AI-native differentiation

**Recommendation:** Lead with "AI Artifact Collaboration," fall back to "Document Review" for late-majority buyers.

---

## Target Audience Positioning

### Who We're For (Inclusion)

**Primary:** Product teams (5-50 people) at tech companies using AI tools for documentation
- **Profile:** Tool-agnostic, best-of-breed approach (Notion + Linear + Slack, not Google Workspace)
- **Behavior:** Generate 3-10 AI artifacts per week (PRDs, specs, prototypes, presentations)
- **Pain:** Waste 2-5 hours/week converting AI output to shareable formats

**Secondary:** Design teams sharing prototypes, strategy teams sharing one-pagers, consultancies sharing client deliverables

### Who We're NOT For (Exclusion)

**Google Workspace-committed teams:**
- If your entire org lives in Google Docs/Drive and you're happy with it, we're not the solution
- We're for teams frustrated by Google Docs format loss

**Adobe Creative Cloud-committed teams:**
- If you're already paying for Adobe Acrobat Pro and the PDF workflow works, stick with it
- We're for teams who don't need heavyweight Creative Cloud

**Non-AI users:**
- If you're not using AI tools to generate documents, our differentiation doesn't matter
- Use Notion, Coda, or Google Docs—they're great for manual document creation

**Enterprise-only buyers (initially):**
- If you need SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA BAA, or on-prem deployment on Day 1, we're not ready yet
- Come back in 6-12 months when we're enterprise-ready

### Strategic Focus

**"We're the collaboration layer for AI-first, best-of-breed toolchain teams—not competing in enterprise productivity suite land."**

---

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Notion AI (Priority #1)

**Their Strength:** All-in-one workspace with AI built in
**Their Weakness:** Can't import external AI output (Claude Code HTML) with fidelity

**Our Position:**
> "Purpose-built for AI artifact review—not trying to be your docs, wiki, and project management. Import from any AI tool (Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT), get feedback, move on. Lightweight, not bloated."

**When to Win:**
- Teams already using Notion but frustrated by import limitations
- Users who want best-of-breed tools (Claude for generation, Notion for docs, us for review)
- Users who don't want to force stakeholders into Notion ecosystem

---

### vs. Claude Team Projects (Priority #2)

**Their Strength:** Native Claude integration, conversation context
**Their Weakness:** Requires all reviewers to have Claude accounts ($30-60/user/mo)

**Our Position:**
> "We're for sharing with people who *don't* have Claude—your executives, clients, cross-functional stakeholders. Artifact-only sharing, no conversation history needed. Plus, we work with Cursor, ChatGPT, and any AI tool."

**When to Win:**
- Claude Code users who need to share with non-Claude users
- Teams using multiple AI tools (not just Claude)
- Users who want structured review workflow (approval gates, due dates, status tracking)

**Strategic Advantage:**
- MCP integration for one-click sharing from Claude Code (planned)
- Multi-tool support (not locked to Claude ecosystem)

---

### vs. Google Docs (Priority #3)

**Their Strength:** Universal, free, familiar
**Their Weakness:** Destroys HTML formatting (tables break, styling lost)

**Our Position:**
> "Preserve the AI output exactly as generated—no formatting lost, no 30-minute cleanup. For teams not locked into Google Workspace."

**When to Win:**
- Teams frustrated by format loss in Google Docs
- Users who value professional presentation (formatting matters)
- Teams using best-of-breed tools (Notion + Linear + Slack, not Google-committed)

---

### vs. Adobe Acrobat (Priority #4)

**Their Strength:** Industry-standard review workflow, excellent commenting
**Their Weakness:** Requires HTML → PDF conversion (format change, not web-native)

**Our Position:**
> "No conversion step, web-native, designed for AI workflows. For teams that don't need Creative Cloud."

**When to Win:**
- Teams outside Adobe ecosystem looking for lightweight artifact review
- Users who want responsive, updatable artifacts (not static PDFs)
- Users frustrated by PDF export losing interactivity

---

### vs. Current Workarounds (The Real Competition)

**What users do today:**
- Screenshot + email (no interactivity)
- Manual copy-paste to Google Docs (formatting breaks)
- GitHub Gist / Codepen (no commenting)
- Zip files (clunky, no collaboration)

**Our Position:**
> "Stop screenshotting and emailing. Get inline feedback in 2 clicks."

**When to Win:**
- Users who have tried workarounds and know they're painful
- First-time AI users who don't have an established workflow yet
- Teams looking to professionalize their AI output sharing

---

## Positioning Pillars

These are the 3-5 core value propositions that anchor all messaging.

### Pillar 1: AI-Native by Design

**Message:** Built specifically for AI-generated HTML artifacts, not retrofitted onto existing doc tools.

**Proof Points:**
- MCP integration with Claude Code (one-click sharing)
- Works with any AI tool (Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT, Gemini)
- Preserves HTML structure and styling perfectly
- Future: AI context panel showing prompts/conversation that generated the doc

**Why It Matters:** AI tools produce HTML because it's the only format with full styling control. We embrace that, not fight it.

---

### Pillar 2: Zero Format Loss

**Message:** What AI generates is what stakeholders see—no copy-paste degradation, no 30-minute cleanup.

**Proof Points:**
- Upload HTML directly, renders pixel-perfect
- Tables, code blocks, diagrams stay intact
- Responsive design preserved
- Export with comments baked in (for handoff)

**Why It Matters:** Google Docs breaks 60%+ of HTML formatting. We preserve 100%.

---

### Pillar 3: Stakeholder Access Without Licenses

**Message:** Reviewers don't need AI tool accounts, Claude licenses, or paid seats—just a link.

**Proof Points:**
- Reviewers comment for free (always)
- No forced signups for stakeholders
- Only creators pay for uploads
- Works for executives, clients, cross-functional partners

**Why It Matters:** Claude Team Projects requires $30-60/user for everyone. We remove that barrier.

---

### Pillar 4: Structured Review Workflow

**Message:** More than just comments—approval gates, due dates, status tracking, team visibility.

**Proof Points:**
- Assign reviewers, track completion
- Set due dates, automated reminders
- Status tracking: Draft → In Review → Approved
- Team activity feed (who reviewed what, when)

**Why It Matters:** Google Docs has comments, but no workflow. We add structure for professional teams.

---

### Pillar 5: Multi-Tool, Best-of-Breed

**Message:** Works with your existing stack—not trying to replace Notion, Linear, or Slack.

**Proof Points:**
- Import from any AI tool (Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT)
- Slack integration (notifications, updates)
- Linear/Jira linking (tie docs to tickets)
- Lightweight workflow (upload → review → done, no migration needed)

**Why It Matters:** Teams don't want another all-in-one tool. We fit into your stack, not replace it.

---

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice Principles

**1. Pragmatic, Not Hype-y**
- We solve a real problem, no need to oversell
- Avoid AI buzzwords ("revolutionary," "transformative," "game-changing")
- Be direct: "Save time, get feedback, ship faster"

**2. Technical but Accessible**
- Our users are PMs and designers, not pure developers
- Use technical terms when accurate (HTML, MCP, API) but explain when needed
- Avoid jargon when plain language works better

**3. Confident but Honest**
- We're first-movers in a new category—own that
- Acknowledge what we don't do (not an all-in-one workspace, not enterprise-ready yet)
- Don't pretend to be bigger than we are

**4. Helpful, Not Sales-y**
- Lead with value and education, not pressure
- Free tier is generous—let users try without friction
- Content marketing: "How to share AI artifacts" not "Buy our tool"

### Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Homepage** | Confident, clear, benefit-focused | "Share AI artifacts. Get inline feedback. Zero format loss." |
| **Pricing Page** | Transparent, value-oriented | "Pro: $12/mo. Save 2+ hours/week vs. manual conversion." |
| **Documentation** | Technical, precise, helpful | "Upload HTML via drag-drop or MCP. Reviewers can comment without accounts." |
| **Error Messages** | Clear, actionable, not apologetic | "Doc limit reached. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited documents." |
| **Marketing Blog** | Educational, pragmatic | "Why AI tools generate HTML (and why Google Docs breaks it)" |
| **Sales/Demos** | Consultative, problem-focused | "Walk me through your current workflow—where does it break down?" |
