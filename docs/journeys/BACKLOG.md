# Features Backlog

This document tracks high-level ideas and prospective features that are not yet ready for a formal User Journey map.

## Reviewer Experience
- **Invitation "Accept" Gate**: Reviewers should have to explicitly accept an invitation before an artifact appears in their workspace.
- **"Leave" Artifact**: Reviewers should be able to remove an artifact from their "Shared with me" list or leave the collaboration entirely.
- **Mute Notifications**: Per-artifact notification silencing to handle high-frequency threads without leaving the artifact.

## Discovery & Sharing
- **Anonymous Commenting**: Allow users to comment without logging in (potentially behind a creator-controlled toggle).
- **Public Artifact Gallery**: A way for creators to showcase their artifacts publicly.

## AI & Automation
- **Prompt Preservation**: Store and display the original prompt used to generate the artifact for context.
- **Auto-Summarization**: AI-generated summaries of comment threads.
