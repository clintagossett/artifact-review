# .envrc - direnv configuration
#
# This file is OPTIONAL. The parent directory (artifact-review-dev/)
# has a .envrc that sets NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS for mkcert trust.
# Direnv automatically walks up the directory tree to find it.
#
# Only create a .envrc here if you need agent-specific env vars:
#
#   source_up                      # Inherit from parent
#   export MY_AGENT_VAR="value"    # Add agent-specific vars
#
# For most cases, you don't need this file at all.
